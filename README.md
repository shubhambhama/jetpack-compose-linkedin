# LinkedIn Clone

A LinkedIn clone project that aims to replicate the main features of LinkedIn, including the dashboard, adding posts, notifications, and messaging. The project is still in development, and more modules are being worked on.

## Features

- **Dashboard**: Users can view and interact with LinkedIn posts, including following/unfollowing, liking, commenting, and sharing. Double-tapping on a post will like the photo.
- **Add Post**: Users can create posts with text, photos, and videos.
- **Notifications**: Dynamic notifications are displayed in this section.
- **Messages**: LinkedIn messages are categorized into "Focused" and "Other" modules.

## Project Details

The project is built with the following technologies and concepts:

- **Clean + MVVM Architecture**: The project follows a clean and MVVM architecture pattern for better code organization and separation of concerns.
- **Dagger Hilt**: Dependency injection framework used for managing dependencies and promoting modularity.
- **Retrofit**: HTTP client library for making API requests and handling network operations.
- **Coil**: Image loading library for efficient and smooth image loading and caching.

## Learning Curve

Throughout the project development, the following concepts were explored and implemented:

1. **Bottom Sheet**: Utilized to create interactive and informative bottom sheet views.
2. **Creating Dialogs**: Implemented custom dialogs for various interactions within the app.
3. **Tab Layout**: Utilized to create a tab-based navigation system within the app.
4. **Composing, Recomposing, and Reusability**: Explored the power of Jetpack Compose for creating reusable and composable UI components.
